# Linux on the Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th
## About this document
I'm here collecting some of the configuration tweaks I did to setup Linux on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th. Most things work out of the box after installing [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/), but there are some exceptions. Another excellent document which also works welll for Xubuntu on the TXC6 is the [Arch Linux guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_6)).
